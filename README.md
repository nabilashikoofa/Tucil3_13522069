## General Information
The Word Ladder game is a puzzle where players have to find a series of words that connect a starting word to an ending word, with each word in between differing by only one letter. This project implements three different search algorithms to solve the Word Ladder game: UCS (Uniform Cost Search), Greedy Best First Search, and A*.

## Features
List the ready features:
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)
- A* Search
- Compare All Algorithms

## Setup
Before the installation process, users need to install the following requirements:
- Java
- Java Swing (for GUI)

Then, clone this repository to your computer.
```
git clone https://github.com/nabilashikoofa/Tucil3_13522069.git
```
Navigate to the "bin" directory
```
cd bin
```

## Usage
To run the Command Line Interface (CLI) or Graphical User Interface (GUI) version, type the following command in your terminal:
```
run Main
```
For running the Graphical User Interface (GUI) version directly, execute the following command in your terminal:
```
run GUI
```
Then, follow the step-by-step instructions provided

## Project Status
Project is:  _complete_ 

## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Adding more search algorithms 
- Enhancing the GUI appearance to be more visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Optimizing the performance of search algorithms to reduce execution time.

## Acknowledgements
This project was created as part of learning about UCS, Greedy Best First Search, and A*. Special thanks to the insightful resources and tutorials that contributed to the understanding and implementation of this algorithm.
